This propgram backups a path to a remote FTP.

Requirements :
* Ruby

Usage:
  ftp_backup <config> <backup name> <backup path> [<tar options...>]

It will tar the whole path and save it to <backup name>.tgz on the FTP server.

It will rename the previous backup to <backup name>.last.tgz if it exists.

Notes:
The program will backup mounted filesystems in the given path. If you want
to exclude them, add the --one-file-system to the command line.

You can also exclude files with --exclude=foo.

Example :
* Copy sample_config.yml to /etc/ftp_backup.yml
* Edit /etc/ftp_backup.yml
* Run "ftp_backup /etc/ftp_backup.yml root / --one-file-system"
